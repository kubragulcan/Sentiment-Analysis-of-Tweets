# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets

The project is interested in the sentiment analysis of tweets. Sentiment analysis determines whether a text contains negative, positive, or neutral emotions. Itâ€™s a form of text analytics that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Most companies use sentiment analysis in customer feedback to understand customer needs, and nowadays it has become simpler, easier, and faster with the development of AI, machines, and deep learning.

The purpose of the study is to create and test a model which is capable of understanding the sentiment of shared tweets. For this purpose, firstly data is visualized, then preprocess procedures are implemented. After the preprocessing, different models are trained. Finally, models are tested and compared among them. Moreover, the best model, which has the highest accuracy rate, is tested with tweets accessed from Twitter API.
